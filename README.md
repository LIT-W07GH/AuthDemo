# AuthDemo

This is a simple demo app that shows how to use authentication in .Net Core. When the user tries to access the Secret page, they get redirected to a login page. There's also a signup page at /account/signup.

A few things to look out for:
* When referencing BCrypt in the class library, make sure to reference BCrypt.Net-Core from Nuget

Here are the relevant pieces of code needed to make this work. First, you need to set up Authentication in the `Startup.cs` file:

Then, to actually log a user in, here's the code needed for that:

https://github.com/LIT-W07GH/AuthDemo/blob/master/AuthDemo.Web/Controllers/AccountController.cs#L50-L56

To check if a user is logged in, you can use the same `User.Identity.IsAuthenticated` property, and to get the currently logged in users email, you can do `User.Identity.Name`

To log out a user, do the following:
